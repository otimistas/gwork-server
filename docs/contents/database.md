# Database

Only the following three database managers are currently supported.
The name to be set in the environment variable DB_CONNECTION is listed next to the colon.

- mysql: mysql
- postgresql: postgresql
- sqlite: sqlite

They are designed with an interface that allows for easy extension, so implementation code can be added to support other database managers.
